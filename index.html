        <h1>Our Reliance on Computers</h1>
        
        <p>The world is becoming ever more reliant on computers. Many people would probably find it hard to imagine living in a world without them. In fact, 73% of US adults own a desktop or laptop computer, and 68% own a smartphone. But what would be affected if we lost access to computers, for example, because of an EMP attack?</p>

        <h3>Civilian Impacts</h3>

        <p>The entertainment industry is dominated by computer technology. Streaming services, digital books, and of course video games. At least 78% of US households own a video game system. But entertainment is not the most important part. Communication has also become increasingly digital. Aside from the use of phones for calling and texting, around 73% of Americans use social media. Losing computers would not only mean losing a large portion of entertainment, but communication as well.</p>

        <h3>Government Impacts</h3>

        <p>The US government has relied on computer technology for a long time now, and many important systems are made possible by it. Medicare, social security, other government benefit programs, and more, would likely be impossible without computer technology.</p>

        <h3>Economic Impacts</h3>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, computer technology dominates the entertainment industry. But in a broader view, the digital economy produced $3.7 trillion in 2021, which was approximately 7% of that year's GDP. The loss of computers would cut a large portion of the US' GDP if not restored quickly.</p>
